## 🔄 Workflow Implementation

### 1. **Task Creation Flow**
```
Client Request → File Upload → Task Creation → Database Storage → Status: PENDING
```

### 2. **Task Distribution Flow**
```
Pending Tasks → Miner Selection → Task Assignment → Status: DISTRIBUTED
```

### 3. **Processing Flow**
```
Miner Processing → Response Submission → First Response Feedback → Completion Tracking
```

### 4. **Validation Flow**
```
All Miners Complete → Status: DONE → Validator Evaluation → Rewards → Status: APPROVED
```
